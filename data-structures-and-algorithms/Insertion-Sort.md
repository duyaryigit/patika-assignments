**Insertion Sort Project**

1. [22,27,16,2,18,6] -> Insertion Sort

- Write the stages of the above sequence according to the sort type.

```
[16,22,27,2,18,6]

[2,16,22,27,18,6]

[2,16,18,22,27,6]

[2,6,16,18,22,27]
```

2. Write the Big-O notation.

```
Insertion Sort--> O(nÂ²)
```


3. Time Complexity:
- Average case: The number we are looking for is in the middle
- Worst case: The number we're looking for is at the end.
- Best case: The number we're looking for is at the beginning of the array.
- What case does the number 18 fall into after the array is sorted? Write.

```
Since the number 18 is in the middle with 16, it is included in the Average case.
```

4. [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6] Write the first 4 steps of the array according to the Insertion Sort.

```
[3,7,5,8,2,9,4,15,6]

[3,5,7,8,2,9,4,15,6]

[2,3,5,7,8,9,4,15,6]

[2,3,4,5,7,8,9,15,6]
```
